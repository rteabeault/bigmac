# Look in the repo RallySoftware/dev-setup and run the default role
bigmac install RallySoftware/dev-setup

# Look in the repo RallySoftware/dev-setup and run the foo role
bigmac install RallySoftware/dev-setup --role foo

# Look in the repo RallySoftware/dev-setup and run the recipe foo. This
# assumes that dev-setup is a cookbook.
bigmac install RallySoftware/dev-setup::foo

# Look in the repo RallySoftware/dev-setup and run the default role.  Since the 
# repository is private pass the username and you will be prompted for the password
bigmac install --username rteabeault RallySoftware/dev-setup

# Indicate that this is a private machine. Default is shared. This will set a
# node[:machine_type] = :private
bigmac install --private RallySoftware/dev-setup

# Indicate that this is a shared machine. This will set a
# node[:machine_type] = :shared
bigmac install --shared RallySoftware/dev-setup
